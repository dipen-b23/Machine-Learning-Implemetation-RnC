# Robotics and Circuits TaskPhase
# This Task has given me knowledge about implementation of regression. Linear Polynomial and Ridge, Lasso Regression to be specific. 
# I have learnt about all the challenges that have come while implementing and coding the problems. 
# The specific instruction of not using Scikit-Learn has made this problem a little harder to code but has helped me understand the math behind the regression models.
